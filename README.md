Description
This C++ program simulates a simple process scheduler using a lottery scheduling 
algorithm. The scheduler manages processes, each having a unique identifier and a 
set of lottery tickets. The lottery scheduling algorithm randomly selects a ticket, 
and the process holding that ticket gets scheduled next.


Features
Process Management: Each process is uniquely identified and can hold multiple lottery 
tickets.
Lottery Scheduling: Processes are selected for execution based on a random drawing of 
lottery tickets.
Random Ticket Allocation: The scheduler randomly allocates between 1 to 3 lottery tickets 
to each process.
Fair Chance of Selection: Every ticket has an equal chance of being selected, making the
process selection fair and random.


Conclusion
This program is a basic simulation of the lottery scheduling algorithm,
providing an example of how processes can be selected randomly for execution in a system.
It demonstrates the use of standard C++ libraries for process management, random number 
generation, and basic algorithm implementation.
